# Elektron MachineDrum SysEx dump -> MIDI

This is a simple tool to convert pattern data from MachineDrum SysEx dump files into MIDI format. When Autechre released SysEx dumps for their 2008 live set, which included SysEx data from both the MachineDrum and MonoMachine, I wanted to have a look at the patterns. However, not owning either of these machines, the only option was to convert them into a more common format. If there is enough demand, I might expand the current implementation to handle things like accents and kit contents. 

This tool could also be useful as a starting point for anyone wishing to utilize patterns or other data from their MachineDrum/MonoMachine devices.

## Possible enhancements

- Support for accents
- Support for swing
- Conversion of the kit information into a human-readable format.
